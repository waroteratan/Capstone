This application was created as part of the Coursera Data Science Capstone Course requirement. The project's goal is to create a predictive text model combined with a gleaming app UI that will predict the next word as the user types a sentence, similar to how most smart phone keyboards are implemented today using Swiftkey technology.

Steps
1. When you first launch the application, the Predicted Next Word textbox will display "NULL."
2.To begin the next word prediction, the user may enter a partially completed sentence.

Results
1.The predicted next word appears in the Predicted Next Word textbox.
2.As an indication, information on the n-gram backoff algorithm used to predict is displayed.
